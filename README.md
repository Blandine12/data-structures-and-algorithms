# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

unshift methode helps push element to array from the front, I think it will be good and easy fo me to use that methode with a given array  and I can unshift to revearse them. It might be another methode that will help to push the reverse number into a new array.
