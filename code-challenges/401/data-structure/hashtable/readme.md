### Challenge
- Implement a Hashtable 


- [submission PR](https://github.com/Blandine12/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/38)


### Approach & Efficiency

- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.

- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

### Test
- npm test hashtable
