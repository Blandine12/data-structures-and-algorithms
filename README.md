# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

unshift methode helps push element to array from the front, I think it will be good and easy fo me to use that methode with a given array  and I can unshift to revearse them. It might be another methode that will help to push the reverse number into a new array.

# Shift Array

## Challenge

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

- create an empty array to add elements to as I believed it would be more difficult to modify the input array.
- created an independan counter for the new array as they will have different lengths eventually. 
- iterate through the input array and insert each element into the new array with each iteration. 
- returned the new array.
